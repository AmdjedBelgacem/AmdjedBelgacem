# Hey, It's me! Amdjed Belgacem
A passionate full-stack web developer who is his only purpose to provide something that might revolutionize the online world into something better!
I am currently finishing my Masters in CyberSecurity as well as having my last steps in so far one of the best bootcamps also known as Re:Coded.
I am constantly seeking something to learn and develop myself and my goal is to hopefully master as many languages and skills as possible! Life Long Learning!
I am very much open to any kind of collaboration that is connected to Web development or backend development so don't hesitate to contact me!
Fun fact: I am on the road to becoming a polyglot, I speak: English, Arabic, French, Turkish, Maltese (found out I am able to speak it not too long ago by mistake), and basic Russian.
Some of my Hobbies: Gym, Playing Guitar, Singing, Gaming, Learning Languages and Coding.
I am currently Working on my Portfolio and going to have a mentorship hosted by Re:Coded.
Here are some of the Languages that I can code in :
